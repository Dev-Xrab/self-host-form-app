// Splits a form's flat question list into pages the way Google Forms does: a `section`
// row becomes the header of a new page, and every question after it (until the next
// section, or the end of the list) belongs to that page. Questions before the first
// section marker become a leading, untitled page. A form with no sections at all comes
// back as a single page — so a simple form keeps today's one-screen behavior.
