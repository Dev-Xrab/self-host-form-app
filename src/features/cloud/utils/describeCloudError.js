// Maps a thrown cloudApi error (see services/cloudApi.js request() — carries .status and

// failures, instead of a raw API/network error string. Falls back to the server's own message
// for anything unrecognized rather than guessing at wording that might mislead — that message is
// already reasonable, just not always calibrated for a non-technical host (e.g. a bare "Failed to
// fetch").
